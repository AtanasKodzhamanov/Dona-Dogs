# www.DonaDogs.org

DonaDogs is a website developed for a Bulgarian dog shelter using the Django web framework. This platform allows for dynamic customisation via Django's admin panel. It empowers the shelter to manage the site's structure by adding new sections on any page and adjusting the layout's color and positioning.

The website supports both Bulgarian and English languages. Static translations are handled by Django, while dog descriptions and section content are pulled dynamically from the underlying models.
